**Arto — the Art of Reading Markdown.**

---

Markdown has become more than a lightweight markup language — it's the medium for documentation, communication, and thinking in the developer's world.

While most tools focus on _writing_ Markdown, **Arto is designed for _reading_ it beautifully**.

> The name "Arto" comes from "Art of Reading" — reflecting the philosophy that reading Markdown is not just a utility task, but a quiet, deliberate act of understanding and appreciation.

- Drag and drop a file onto this window
- Use `Cmd+O` to browse and open a file

- Use `Cmd+B` to toggle the sidebar file explorer
