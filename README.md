**Arto — the Art of Reading Markdown.**

A local app that faithfully recreates GitHub-style Markdown rendering for a beautiful reading experience.

## Philosophy

Markdown has become more than a lightweight markup language — it's the medium for documentation, communication, and thinking in the developer's world. While most tools focus on _writing_ Markdown, **Arto is designed for _reading_ it beautifully**.

The name "Arto" comes from "Art of Reading" — reflecting the philosophy that reading Markdown is not just a utility task, but a quiet, deliberate act of understanding and appreciation.

Arto faithfully reproduces GitHub's Markdown rendering in a local, offline environment, offering a calm and precise reading experience with thoughtful typography and balanced whitespace.

## Usage

Use [Homebrew] tap to install. Since the application is not signed or notarized with an Apple Developer ID, you'll need to remove the quarantine attribute after installation.
See [homebrew-tap] for more information.

```
brew install --cask arto-app/tap/arto
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Arto.app
```

Alternatively, [Nix] is also supported.
To try it without a permanent installation:

```
nix run github:arto-app/Arto
```

For a permanent installation, use [nix-darwin] or [home-manager].
Add the following to your flake inputs:

```nix
arto.url = "github:arto-app/Arto";
```

Then add it to `environment.systemPackages` (nix-darwin) or `home.packages` (home-manager):

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.arto.packages.${system}.default ];
```

Launch the application to see the welcome screen with keyboard shortcuts and usage instructions.
